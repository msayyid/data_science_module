    "advantages: easily identifies trends andpatterns, no human intervention needed, continuous improvement, handling multidimensional and multiovariety data web application\n",

    "1 supervisesd learning - a system is trained with data that has been labelled; the labels categorise each data point into one or more groups, such as 'apples' or 'oranges(simple def needed), 2. unsupervised learning - learning without labels, it aims to detect the characteristics that maek datapoint more or less similar to each other(simple def needed), 3. reinforcement learning(simple def needed)\n",
