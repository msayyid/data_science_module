    "###  Representing Data in Python\n",
    "Machine Learning provides tools to extract knowledge from **data**. o build and deploy a machine learning solution, our data science computing environment needs to be able to represent our data and has to provide **methods** to manipulate and process that data. Specifically, our data science environment needs to be able to efficiently represent and process **datasets**, i.e. collections of items described by a set of attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore different options to represent data and datasets in Python. We will refer to them as data types. In addition to the basic built-in types, we will discuss data types defined by two third-party specialised libraries, namely **NumPy** and **Pandas**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we have explored several options to represent data and datasets in Python, including:\n",
    "- Basic numeric, boolean and string types\n",
    "- Standard lists\n",
    "- Numpy arrays\n",
    "- Pandas Series and DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, NumPy arrays will be our preferred choice to represent complex data on a grid (such as time series and pictures) and homogeneous datasets, where all the attributes are of the same type. Pandas dataframes will be useful to represent heterogeneous datasets, where different attributes can have different types. There are additional subtleties, which you will learn as you develop your machine learning skills.\n",

Sequences are ordered collections and can be used to represent a **complex attribute** (such as text), an **item** described by several attributes or even a **whole dataset**. As we shall see later, there are other options that might be more suitable to represent complex attributes and whole datasets, however it is important to be familiar with sequences. \n",

Our small dataset is based on the well-known [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset, which consists of 70,000 gray scale 28x28 images of handwritten digits. Instead of gray scale images, where each entry (pixel) can take any value within a continuous range (for instance 0 and 1), we have pictures where pixels can take up only two values, namely 0 and 7. There is nothing special about these two values, what is relevant is that the pattern displayed depends on which pixels take which value. \n",

    "Pandas is a specialised library that provides data structures to represent sequences (known as **Series**) and tables (known as **DataFrames**). You can think of a Pandas DataFrame as a 2D table where each column is a 1D Pandas Series. In fact, when you extract one single column from a DataFrame, the data type that you obtain is a Series.\n",
