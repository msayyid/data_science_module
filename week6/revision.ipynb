    "\n",
    "### Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample space (Ω)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The set of *all possible outcomes* of an experiment.\n",
    "* Example: rolling a die -> Ω = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Event**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A *subset* of the sample space (some outcomes you care about).\n",
    "* Example: “roll an even number” -> {2, 4, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Probability that event **A** happens *given that* event **B** already happened.\n",
    "* Notation: **P(A | B)**\n",
    "* Intuition: you are “zooming in” to only the cases where **B** is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random variable (RV)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A function that maps outcomes to numbers.\n",
    "* Example: roll two dice, let X = sum. Outcomes are pairs (1..6, 1..6), but X is a number from 2 to 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A rule that tells you how probabilities are assigned.\n",
    "* For discrete RVs: probability for each value.\n",
    "* For continuous RVs: probability “density” across values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PMF (Probability Mass Function)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Used for **discrete** random variables.\n",
    "* Gives **P(X = x)** directly (exact value probabilities).\n",
    "\n",
    "**PDF (Probability Density Function)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Used for **continuous** random variables.\n",
    "* PDF value is *not* a probability by itself.\n",
    "* Probabilities come from *area under the curve* over an interval:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **P(a ≤ X ≤ b)** = area under PDF from a to b\n",
    "\n",
    "**CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Works for **both discrete and continuous**.\n",
    "* Definition: **F(x) = P(X ≤ x)** (probability that X is at most x).\n",
    "* CDF is always non-decreasing and goes from 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normal (Gaussian) distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A very common continuous distribution with a “bell curve” shape.\n",
    "* Defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **mean (μ)**: center of the curve\n",
    "  * **standard deviation (σ)**: spread (how wide it is)\n",
    "* Many real-world measurements are approximately normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matrix**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A rectangular table of numbers (rows x columns).\n",
    "* Used to represent data, linear transformations, systems of equations, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identity matrix (I)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A square matrix with 1s on the main diagonal and 0s elsewhere.\n",
    "* Acts like “1” for matrix multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **A · I = A** and **I · A = A** (when sizes match)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matrix addition**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can add matrices only if they have the same shape.\n",
    "* Add element-by-element:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * (A + B)[i, j] = A[i, j] + B[i, j]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matrix multiplication**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Not element-by-element (that’s different).\n",
    "* If A is (m x n) and B is (n x p), then A·B is (m x p).\n",
    "* Each entry is a dot product:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * (A·B)[i, j] = sum over k of A[i, k] * B[k, j]\n",
    "* Order matters: **A·B ≠ B·A** in general."
